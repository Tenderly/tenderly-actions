## Introduction

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co) Web3 Actions are programmable hooks for smart contract and chain events. They can also
be serverless backends for your dapps. A Web3 Action is a regular TypeScript/JavaScript function that runs on Tenderly
infrastructure.

A Web3 Action comes with key-value storage for data you need to persist and secrets management for sensitive information
such as API keys. You can think of Web3 Actions as infrastructure building a Web3 version of IFTTT/Zapier automation,
allowing you to glue together your smart contracts, on-chain events, dapp frontends, APIs, and other services.

Based on the trigger rules you define, external on-chain or off-chain events will trigger your Web3 Action and your
TypeScript/JavaScript code will handle the event instantly.

With Web3 Actions, you can build systems that let you be timely informed about non-trivial events. This way, you can
improve your dapp in terms of UX and interactivity and enhance your project through the depth of information you can
collect or share through notifications.

> The code Web3 Actions run is called a **function**. Function must be written in TypeScript/JavaScript and runs in
**Node** runtime. Specification of events that your action listens to is called a **trigger**.

## Getting Started

Follow these guides to quickly get started with building Web3 Actions via the browser or command line tools.

Read our [documentation](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions) to get started with Tenderly Web3 Actions.

Setting up Web3 Actions requires you to write TypeScript/JavaScript code for your functions. Building your Web3 Actions
using Tenderly CLI includes defining triggers in a [yaml configuration file](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/references/project-structure#the-tenderly.yaml-file-structure).
The defined trigger and yaml configuration become an integral part of your projectâ€™s codebase.
